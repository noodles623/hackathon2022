# hackathon2022

This project is for Cornell digital agriculture hackathon 2022. We are employing Microsoft Azure to do image processing. This project targeted on cows and their living conditions. We took the pictures from Cornell Diary Farm on Mar.12th, 2022. 

We are employing C# in our project. Since the diary farm contains 2 rows, we divided our thermal camera into camera_1 and camera_2.
